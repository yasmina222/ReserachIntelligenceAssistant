School Research Assistant - Data Loader
========================================
NEW FILE (doesn't replace anything - this is new functionality)

WHAT THIS FILE DOES:
- Loads your 28 Camden schools from the CSV file
- Converts each row into a School Pydantic model
- Provides search/filter functions
- FUTURE: Will connect to Databricks with minimal code changes

HOW TO USE:
    loader = DataLoader()
    
    # Get all schools
    schools = loader.get_all_schools()
    
    # Get school names for dropdown
    names = loader.get_school_names()
    
    # Get specific school
    school = loader.get_school_by_name("Thomas Coram Centre")

HOW TO SWITCH TO DATABRICKS LATER:
    # Just change one line in config_v2.py:
    DATA_SOURCE = "databricks"  # instead of "csv"
    
    # The DataLoader will automatically use Databricks connection
